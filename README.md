__Date:__ Dec 2022 - Jan 2023

This exercize in anticipating customer churn was inspired by the 2022 Holiday Community App-Building Challenge in the [Plotly Dash Python forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/holiday-community-app-building-challenge/70393/4).

__Data:__ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/telco-customer-churn-by-IBM.csv (The customer churn data was provided by [IBM](https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/?context=analytics&query=telco&type=Data) to solve business problems and predict customer churn for a fictional telecommunication company.)<br />
__Data description:__ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iazD22swSw6CJAVDwkVk-Ynh-r-4meWclfQ0jVMMubU/edit?usp=sharing

## Objective
Create an app, and share it by replying to the Forum topic by midnight Saturday, January 14. 

Share:
- app code
- a link to the deployed app if possible

Judging for winning apps according to the following categories:
- Ability to provide insight on the relationship between churn and customers’ characteristics
- App Design
- Data exploration and data analysis routines (e.g. numerical methods, machine learning, prediction, classification, optimization)
